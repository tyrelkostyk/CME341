                ;   This program for tests part of the EE431 miroprocessor 
                ;   The test result requires that all the register and the
                ;   memory work for either load or mov instructions
                ;
                ;   The enitire program is in a loop. The loop starts by 
                ;   loading 1 into the M register and 0 into the I register. 
                ;   It then mov I_pins (ireg) to location 0 of data memory
                ;   through a chain of moves from X0 to X1 to Y0 to Y1 to DM.
                ;   It then executes a loop which sum the sixteen numbers stored
                ;   in data memory. It then writes this number to o_reg and then
                ;   clears o_reg in the next instruction.  After clearing o_reg
                ;   the program jumps to the beginning
                ;
                ;   The output is a series of pulse on oreg with the value of
                ;   oreg=2*IREG+9, where the value of IREG is sampled at the end of 
                ;   the third instruction which occurs 4 clock edges after reset
                ;   goes low and again 4 clock periods after oreg is cleared.
