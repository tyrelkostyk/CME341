This can be done by deleting the always procedure above and answering the questions in separate modules, perhaps named student_circuit_Q1, student_circuit_Q2, student_circuit_Q3 and student_circuit_Q4.
Then one of these modules is instantiate within this module.  For example the answer to question 1, 2, 3, or 4 is answered by uncommenting the instantiation of interest
